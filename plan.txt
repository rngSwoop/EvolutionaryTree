We will be implementing a program that builds and manipulates trees. The program will be used to compare the sequences 
within the trees and build a structure that follows a hierarchical pattern, which states the relationship between the 
species in the tree. We plan to start working on the constructor first and then work our way to the inputs and outputs, 
writing files. Essentially follow the sequence of methods that need to be written.

For now, our plan for the schedule is to meet everyday , on the lab from 4 to 7pm everyday, initially. Potentially, we 
could fill more hours during the day if needed.

We feel that the most challenging aspect of this assignment is going to be finding time to work on the program together 
as much as we can, since it´s a pair programming project.

A list of sources we plan to use if we get stuck would be the professor´s office hours, TA office hours and the CS 
tutoring center.
